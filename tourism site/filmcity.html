                <p>The attractions at the Hyderabad film city are diverse and will keep you engaged for an entire day or more. Hereâ€™s a list of the top things to see in Ramoji Film City. 

                    Ramoji Film City came into existence as the brainchild of Cherukuri Rama Rao, better known as Ramoji Rao, who is a well-known media entrepreneur, businessman, and film producer in India. He wanted the city to be something similar to the ones in Hollywood, in scale as well as facilities. Over 2000 acres of land was procured for the purpose and Nitish Roy, a famous art director, was assigned the task of designing the whole complex. The film city was set up in 1996 and was opened to the public shortly after.</p>
