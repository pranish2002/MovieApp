            <p class="about">Hussain Sagar (also known as Tank Bund) is a heart-shaped lake in Hyderabad, Telangana,
                built in 1563 by Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah. It covers an area of 5.7 square kilometres (2.2 square miles)
                and is fed by the Musi River. A large monolithic statue of Gautama Buddha, erected in 1992, stands in
                the middle of the lake on Gibraltar Rock. It also separates Hyderabad’s city centre from its neighbour
                Secunderabad.The lake’s maximum depth is 32 feet (9.8 m)

                Hyderabad is the state capital of Telangana (separated from Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014). N. T. Rama
                Rao was the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 1983 to 1989. During his presidency, he spent a lot of
                money erecting statues of people from the region’s political and religious history. He saw the Statue of
                Liberty during his visit to New York and was inspired by the efforts to restore it. “I wanted something
                like that wonderful place to visit… That would have been my contribution to society,” he explained.

                Rama Rao depicted Gautama Buddha because “He was a humanitarian who told the people the whole truth. It
                is our source of pride.” He discovered a solid white granite rock on a mountainside 46 kilometres
                outside Hyderabad near Raigir, Bhuvanagiri (Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district). NTR began structure work in
                October 1985. Hundreds of labourers assisted temple architect and builder S.M.Ganapathi Sthapathi in the
                creation of the statue over a year. After five years and a US$3 million investment, the statue stood at
                58 feet (18 m) and weighed 350 tonnes, making it the world’s tallest monolithic Buddha statue
                Hyderabad.To aid in the erecting of the statue, a 15-foot (4.6-meter) concrete platform known as the
                “Rock of Gibraltar” was built in the middle of Hussain Sagar. The city’s roads were also widened for
                this purpose.<br>

            <h3>HISTORY OF TANK BUND</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah constructed Hussain Sagar across a tributary of the Musi river in 1563. The lake
                was named after Hussain Shah Wali, the Kingdom’s Master of Architecture. It is an artificial lake that
                is perpetually fed by canals from the Musi River. Before Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar were built on the
                Musi River, Hussain Sagar was the main source of water supply to Hyderabad.

                The Buddha statue was carved from a 450-ton white granite rock. It took 200 sculptors two years to
                complete. In November 1988, the statue was transported to Hyderabad. After some difficulties, the statue
                was erected on a red lotus pedestal on April 12, 1992.

                When Sir Mirza Ismail was prime minister of Hyderabad Deccan in 1946, the Tank Bund road was widened.
                The Tank Bund was further expanded and beautified by the then-Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N.T.Rama Rao
                in 1987-88, with the addition of fountains with dancing waters, tantalising coloured lights at night,
                and bronze statues of renowned personalities.</p>
