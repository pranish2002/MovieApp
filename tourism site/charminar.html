            <p class="about">The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a mosque on its top floor for more than 425 years. While both historically and religiously significant, it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.
                
                The Charminar is situated on the east bank of Musi River.[5] To the west lies the Laad Bazaar, and to the southwest lies the richly ornamented granite Makkah Masjid.[6] It is listed as an archaeological and architectural treasure on the official list of monuments prepared by the Archaeological Survey of India.[7] The English name is a translation and combination of the Urdu words chār and minar or meenar, translating to "Four Pillars"; the eponymous towers are ornate minarets attached and supported by four grand arches.[6] <br>
                
                <h3>ARCHITECTURE OF CHARMINAR</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>An Iranian architect Mir Momin Astrawadi, who had settled in Hyderabad, designed Charminar. It presents an imposing structure which has clearly withstood the test of time. It is a square shaped monument with four pillars, one on each side. The architectural design of Charminar is inspired from the Shia “tazias”. These Tazias were built in the memory of Hussain, who was the son in law of Prophet Muhhamed and had lost his life in the battle of Karbala.

                    The square shape of the monument measures 20 meters on each side. Each side of the monument is 11 meter wide and overlooks the four prominent thoroughfares. Charminar has been built with granite and lime mortar.
                    
                    The four pillars around Charminar represent the four caliphs. These pillars or minars are 48.7 meters high. These are four stories, with each floor divided by intricately carved rings that surround it. On the top floor of Chaminar there is a mosque which is believed to be the oldest mosque of Hyderabad city. There are 45 prayer spaces or musallah. Attached to these is the open space which can be used to accommodate more people on occasions like Friday prayers or festivals. It is located at the western end of the monument’s roof. It can be reached via 149 winding steps. The view from the top is also breathtaking.</p>
