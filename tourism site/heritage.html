                <p>The iconic symbol of Hyderabad, the very well known Charminar is located in the Old City. It was
                    built by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah in 1591 in the honor of his wife Bhagmati.
                    Also referred to as the ‘Arc de Triomphe of the East’, Charminar is adorned with four towers in each
                    corner. Lighting in the evening is quite glamorous and makes for a worth watching site.
                    No visit to Hyderabad is complete without witnessing the grandeur of Charminar. It is a top pick
                    among travelers who prefer exploring the city with our Hyderabad sightseeing tour by private car.

                <p>Resembling a necklace, the Necklace Road of Hyderabad is stretched over 3 km length. Said to be inspired by the Queen’s Necklace of Mumbai, it acts as a connecting point to three major parts, running from NTR Gardens and Lumbini Parks to Sanjeevaiah Park, in turn forming a shape of necklace.

                    It is adjacent to the Hussain Sagar Lake where you can find a variety of entertaining choices. The eat street here serves as a popular hangout place with an extensive range of food stalls. It tops the list of best Hyderabad tourist attractions to visit in the evening.
