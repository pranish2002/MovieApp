                estimated â‚¹1,000 crore (US$130 million), the project was paid for through the donations of devotees in a

            <h3>DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In 2014, ascetic Chinna Jeeyar came up with the idea to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of Ramanuja's
                teachings by building a statue.[3][better source needed] Later DNV Prasad Sthapathi appointed as Chief
                Architect for the project and completed all initial drawings under the Chinna Jeeyer Guidance. The
                ground floor will be 6,000 square metres and will depict Ramanuja's life and philosophy. The temple,
                meant for daily worship, will be located on the 27,870 square metre second floor. The 1,365 square metre
                third floor will include a Vedic digital library and research centre.[4][additional citation(s) needed]
                An Omnimax theatre in the shape of a planetarium featuring life stories of Ramanuja was planned.[5] 14
                models were designed according to Agama Shashtra and Shilpa Shastras. 3 models were shortlisted, and
                improvements were made using 3D scanning technology.[6]

                It was named 'Statue of Equality' by the trust.
                <br>

                The foundation stone for the statue was laid by Chinna Jeeyar.[citation needed] The statue was expected
                to be ready by November 2017 and later revised to February 2019.Aerosun Corporation, a
                Nanjing-based company, was contracted in August 2015 for the construction of the statue. The
                final design model was 3D scanned and sent to Aerosun Corporation to be built. 700 tonnes of panchaloha,
                a five-metal alloy of gold, silver, copper, brass and zinc[clarification needed] was used to build the
                statue. It was built in China and later shipped in 1600 individual pieces to India via Chennai Port
                in 54 shipments. Around 60 Chinese specialists including workers, engineers and welders assembled the
                segments on site. The assembly progressed during 2017 and 2018 and took 15 months to complete.
                and was assembled on site Muchintal, Hyderabad. Aerosun Corporation provided a guarantee of 20 years for
                the golden hue of the statue.[8]

                The base building under the statue named Bhadravedi is 54 feet (16 m) tall and three-stories high.[9]
                Atop the building lies a lotus of 27 feet (8.2 m) in diameter,[5] and is carried by 36 elephants, over
                which the statue sits.[10] The 27-feet dimension of the lotus represent 24 tattvas, and the remaining 3
                representing soul, god and the guru.[5] The statue has a concrete core which is surrounded by a
                panchaloha sheet with a thickness varying between 10 mm and 20 mm.[10] The base building has a
                meditation hall where a 54 inches (1.4 m) statue of Ramunuja made of 120 kg of gold, representing the
                years he lived, is installed.108 divyadesams (model temples), built in stone, surround the
                statue.

                The statue was inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 5 February 2022.[13] The smaller
                golden statue inside the base building was inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind on 13 February
                2022.
